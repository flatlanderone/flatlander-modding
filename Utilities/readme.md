# Flatlander's Utility Modlet Pack 2.3.0.4

## About

The Modlet Pack contains my growing collection of modlets I use for development and testing.

## 1. Any Starting Trader 

Your starting trader is the closest trader in the biome in which you complete the Basics of Survival challenges.

## 2. Any Starting Trader - No Desert

Your starting trader is the closest trader in the biome in which you complete the Basics of Survival challenges, unless you complete in the desert biome. In that case, you will be directed to the closest trader in the other biomes.

## 3. Bigger Crafting Resources Pack On Spawn

Adds to inventory a more complete crafting bundle on first spawn. Make sure to have enough free inventory slots. See bigger_crafting_bundle.jpg in the Images folder.

## 4. Dummy Mod To Test Conditionals

Test conditional loading of mods. Replace DummyMod name value with the name of the mod that must be loaded for the coondition to be true or false.

## 5. Restock Trader Inventory

Adds an inventory restock option to all traders without entering dev mode. Based on 0xSteel-QuestsResetOption. See the screenshots in the images folder.

## 6. Skip Basics of Survival Dev Note On Spawn (new)

Adds to inventory the Skip Basics of Survival dev note on first spawn. Reading the note completes automatically the challenges.

## 7. Tester's Delight On Spawn

Adds to inventory the Tester's Delight note on first spawn. Reading the note adds an assortment of dev items.
